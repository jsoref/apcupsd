2007-05-04 19:17  adk0212

	* ReleaseNotes, include/version.h:

	Maybe this time...

2007-05-03 18:31  adk0212

	* src/action.c:

	Do not attempt to cancel shutdowns. Once a shutdown has been
	started there is no way to cleanly stop it and recover. Plus
	deleting the powerfail file causes killpower to be skipped, leaving
	the server shutdown and not restarted. Reported by Yvon Lafaille
	<yvon.lafaille@yahoo.fr>.

2007-05-01 20:26  adk0212

	* src/drivers/usb/linux/linux-usb.c:

	Rewrite device opening logic. The new logic works as follows:	 -
	If user specifies a DEVICE, we will open that device and that
	device	    only. There is no fallback to autodetect. This is
	generaly what users	 expect when they explicitly give DEVICE.
	  - If no DEVICE is specified, we autodetect as before.
	Furthermore, if       we lose the connection to the device, we
	prefer to re-open the same	 device again, but will restart
	autodetection if that fails.	 - If DEVICE is specified using the
	deprecated '[]' syntax, just do       normal autodetection as if
	DEVICE had not been specified at all.

2007-04-30 22:14  adk0212

	* src/drivers/snmp/drv_powernet.c:

	Disable a few CIs that SNMP cards do not support.

2007-04-30 21:37  adk0212

	* src/: action.c, apctest.c:

	Increase self-test timeout to 40 seconds to accomodate the RS 800.
	Contributed by Lars Randers <lars@nstec.dk>.

2007-04-27 19:30  adk0212

	* src/apctest.c:

	Fix apctest crash. When in the EEPROM programming section of
	apctest, if you try to print EEPROM values (item 1) more than once
	during the same session, the program segfaults.  Contributed by
	Ivaylo Haratcherev <I.J.Haratcherev@tudelft.nl>.

2007-04-27 19:25  adk0212

	* src/action.c:

	Normalize shut remote message.

2007-04-27 19:24  adk0212

	* src/drivers/pcnet/pcnet.c:

	Add support for PCNET remote shutdown (SD) signal. Contributed by
	Ivaylo Haratcherev <I.J.Haratcherev@tudelft.nl> and Moshe Hyzon
	<moshe.hyzon@grantstreet.com>.

2007-04-23 19:47  adk0212

	* ChangeLog:

	Rev ChangeLog.

2007-04-23 19:45  adk0212

	* include/version.h:

	Did I say "final"?

2007-04-23 19:37  adk0212

	* src/apctest.c:

	Fix typo in error message.  Reported by Ashley M. Kirchner
	<ashley@pcraft.com>

2007-04-23 19:35  adk0212

	* platforms/redhat/apcupsd.in:

	Update to match Fedora Extras packaging:   - Add "force-reload"
	aliased to "restart"   - "reload" outputs a not implemented error
	- "status" uses the status() function to return the proper LSB
	status	    code and runs apcaccess only if the daemon is running.
	Contributed by Orion Poplawski <orion@cora.nwra.com>.

2007-04-21 20:37  adk0212

	* ChangeLog:

	particular port). Contributed by Curt Sampson

2007-03-25 15:38  adk0212

	* src/lib/apclibnis.c:

	Prevent infinite hang in read_nbytes() when server disappears.
	Many thanks to Jan Ceuleers <jan.ceuleers@computer.org> for
	reporting the hanging and gathering data to track down the cause.

2007-03-25 15:34  adk0212

	* src/libusbhid/parse.c:

	Remove references to int8_t and int16_t.

2007-03-05 22:41  adk0212
